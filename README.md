### Heart Disease Prediction Model

### Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict heart disease based on medical data. The model provides insights for healthcare professionals by analyzing patient information to detect heart disease early.
Dataset
The dataset contains 303 patient records with 14 features, including age, gender, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, and more. It is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
 
### Methodology
•	Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, normalization, and handling missing values.
•	Model Selection: Tested multiple algorithms, with the best-performing model selected.
•	Evaluation: Used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure performance.
•	Deployment: Built an interactive Gradio interface for predictions.

### Results
The final model achieved:
•	Accuracy: 85%
•	Precision: 83%
•	Recall: 87%
•	F1-Score: 85%
### Technologies
•	Python, Scikit-learn, Gradio, Matplotlib, Pandas.
### Future Work
•	Improve model accuracy.
•	Add more features.
•	Enhance the Gradio interface for accessibility.
